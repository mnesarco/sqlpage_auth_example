# SQLPage Authentication and Authorization Example

This is a very basic example of authentication and authorization boilerplate using [SQLPage](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/). I try to avoid verbose code and duplication as much as possible.

# Features

* Login Form
* Signup Form
* Protected pages
* Role based access (RBAC)
* Resource ACL

# Install

```
git clone https://github.com/mnesarco/sqlpage_auth_example.git
cd sqlpage_auth_example
docker compose up
```

# Disclaimer

This is an example of a possible solution using the existing version of [SQLPage=0.17.1](https://github.com/lovasoa/SQLpage/)  Use at your own risk.
